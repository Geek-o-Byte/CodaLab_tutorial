<h3>Welcome!</h3>
<p>The formation temperature is an important and decisive parameter in evaluation of geothermal potential. Despite the abundance of techniques for collecting drilling and well operation data, they do not necessarily provide the real Bottom Hole Temperature (BHT). The flowrate capacity of a geothermal well another important item that should be considered when analyzing data for viability evaluation. We are provided with relevant well data from Oil &amp; Gas fields. Some may show potentials for being converted into geothermal energy source. The questions is what wells are showing geothermal potential and based on those, which areas deserve further evaluation.&nbsp; Machine learning and modeling techniques can be valuable tools in the process of finding solutions for our problem. That is the challenge we are delving into!</p>
<p><strong>Computational modeling:</strong> Use the wrangled and tidy data and create the Machine Learning (ML) model to provide the prediction for the BHT.</p>
